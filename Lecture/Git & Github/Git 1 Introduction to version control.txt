	Version Control System
To evolve software and and inprove the functionality we step by step add more code and when we have significant change to rollout we release a new version of the software.

Features of version system: 
i) it helps to manage release of new version
ii) it helps to manage rollback to old version
iii) it helps to manage who wrote which piece of code
iv) it help to maintain version/snapshots that can be later refferd

Git is free and open source version control system and it is very stable.

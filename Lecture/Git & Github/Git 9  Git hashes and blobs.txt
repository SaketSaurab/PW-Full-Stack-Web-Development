	*  Git hashes and blobs *
How Git internally works?
Git internally heavily depends on hashing and tree like data structures
When we use commond git add then it connverts our code to 40 character hash object 
All the chages comes to blob
BLOB: Binary large object

git cat-file -p / file name.....-> this commond is used to see the file content

git cat-file -t /file name..... -> this commond tells about the type of file

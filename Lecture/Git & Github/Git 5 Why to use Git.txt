* Why to use Git *

To enable git in project : 
	git init  -> it will enable tracking 
	git init will create a .git hidden folder
	if we delete the .git folder then we will loss all the previous commits

git status -> this commond tells you the current state of project

Stage of project: i)Working directory -> ii) Staging area -> iii)Repository
Working directory is also called working tree

When we will create a new file then it will goes to working directory   
Untracked file: files under working directory


To bring you file to staging area from working directory we use git add fileName commond
When your file come to staging area then git will start tracking 
If something is in the staging area it will be probably be the part of the next version/commit
 
We use git commit commond to bring the version to repository from staging area
And we have to also add commit message
Repository: the place where all the versions are saved

git log commond gives us the log of all commit

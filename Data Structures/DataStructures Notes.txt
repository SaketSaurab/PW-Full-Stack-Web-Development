JavaScript Data Types

Primitive Types: Number, String, Boolean, Undefined, Null, Symbol, BigInt
Reference Types: Objects, Arrays, Functions

Primitive Data Types:
Number: Integers and floating-point numbers.
String: Sequence of characters.
Boolean: true or false.
Undefined: Variable declared but not assigned a value.
Null: Intentional absence of object value.
Symbol: Unique identifier.
BigInt: Integers with arbitrary precision.

Non-Primitive Data Types:
Objects: Defined with {}; collection of properties and methods.
Arrays: List-like objects in [], items separated by commas.
Functions: Callable objects.

**JavaScript Variables and Constants**

### Variables:
- Store data in a program.
- Declare using `var` or `let`.

### Var vs Let:
- `var` is older and has function scope.
- `let` is modern and has block scope.

### Naming Rules:
1. Start with a letter, `_`, or `$`.
2. Cannot start with numbers.
3. Case-sensitive (e.g., `age` is different from `Age`).
4. Avoid JavaScript keywords (e.g., `if`, `else`).

### Constants:
- Value cannot change after being set.
- Declare using `const`.
- Always initialize when declaring.

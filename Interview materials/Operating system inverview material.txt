            3: Software Components
* Operating System (OS): Manages hardware and software (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux).
* Application Software: Programs for user tasks (e.g., Microsoft Office, web browsers).
* System Software: Supports application software and manages hardware (e.g., device drivers).

                        7: Types of Operating Systems
1. Batch OS: Processes jobs in batches without user interaction.
   * Simple Batch System: Processes one job at a time.
   * Multiprogramming Batch System: Runs multiple jobs concurrently.

                        8: Multi-Processor & Distributed OS
1. Multiprocessor OS: Uses multiple CPUs to improve performance by parallel processing.
2. Distributed OS: Allows applications to run on multiple interconnected computers, sharing resources like memory and storage.

                        9: Real-Time Operating System (RTOS)
* Designed for time-critical tasks with guaranteed response times.
* Prioritizes consistent execution over throughput.

                        10: Operating System Architectures
1. Monolithic Architecture: The OS is a single large process running entirely in kernel mode.
2. Layered Architecture: Organizes the system into layers with each layer depending on the one below it.
3. Microkernel Architecture: Only essential components (like memory management and inter-process communication) run in kernel mode; other services run in user mode.
4. Hybrid Architecture: Combines features of monolithic and microkernel architectures.

                        11: Process and Threads
* Process: An executing program.
   * States: New, Running, Waiting, Ready, Terminated.
* Process Control Block (PCB): Stores process information like state, ID, and memory usage.
* Threads: Lightweight processes sharing the same resources, improving CPU utilization.
________________


                        12: Process Synchronization and Concurrency
1. Critical Section Problem: Ensures that only one process accesses shared resources at a time.
2. Concurrency: Refers to the execution of multiple processes simultaneously.
3. Synchronization Mechanisms: Include locks, semaphores, and barriers to manage concurrent processes.

                        13: CPU Scheduling
* Schedulers:
   1. Long-term Scheduler: Decides which jobs are admitted into the system.
   2. Short-term Scheduler: Allocates the CPU to processes in the ready queue.
   3. Medium-term Scheduler: Handles swapping processes in and out of memory.
* Scheduling Algorithms:
   1. First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS): Serves processes in the order they arrive.
   2. Shortest Job Next (SJN): Prioritizes shorter jobs.
   3. Priority Scheduling: Allocates CPU based on priority.
   4. Round Robin: Each process gets a fixed time slice.

                        14: Deadlock
* Deadlock: A situation where processes are waiting on each other, causing a standstill.
* Conditions for Deadlock:
   1. Mutual exclusion.
   2. Hold and wait.
   3. No preemption.
   4. Circular wait.

                        15: Inter-Process Communication (IPC)
* IPC Mechanisms:
   1. Message Passing: Processes exchange data via messages.
   2. Shared Memory: Multiple processes access the same memory space.

                        16: Memory Management
* Memory Management Goals: Allocation, deallocation, protection, sharing, and logical organization.
* Memory Allocation Techniques:
   1. Contiguous Allocation: Allocates memory in a single block.
   2. Non-contiguous Allocation: Allocates memory in different segments (e.g., paging and segmentation).
* Virtual Memory: Allows the system to execute processes that are not entirely in memory.

                        17: File Systems and I/O
1. File System: Organizes and manages files on storage devices.
2. File Attributes: Include name, identifier, type, size, and protection.
3. File System Types: Examples include FAT, NTFS, ext (Linux), HFS (macOS).
* I/O Systems: Manage input/output operations, involving device drivers, buffering, caching, and interrupt handling.
